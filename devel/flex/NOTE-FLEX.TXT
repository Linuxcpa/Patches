Although Flex will build without patches, based on my previous experience (yes 1 time) some programs would complain at configure "can't fimd flex" until I applied these patches.

Some of them are changes indicated to be changed for BeOS, some were from Haikuports.

The deal is this: I believe this is better, but I don't know for sure.

Apply the patches at your own risk, or benefit.
