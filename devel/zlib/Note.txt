For reasons unclear to me, pkgsrc and Haiku together 
will not build a version of zlib with versioning 
information embedded in the library file itself.
Without the patches, the problem is much worse.

This will cause numerous build failures at link time. 
Some of the packages will link with Haiku's libz and, 
as a result, contain versioning information embedded 
in the library. This was the case with libtcl86.

When I attempted to build tkgate, pkgsrc attempted to
link libtcl86 with the libz that was built in Haiku 
with pkgsrc - which has no versioning information. 
The result was an error at link time. 

The only real solution is to take Haiku's libz and 
replace the one built with pkgsrc. Make a copy of 
the file from: /boot/system/lib/libz.so.1.2.8
and place it here: /boot/home/pkg/lib. 

Rename the file to the one already presend.
Replace the existing file if/when promted.

I have included this file because this was part of 
what I did. My procedure is to make available 
everything I did.
