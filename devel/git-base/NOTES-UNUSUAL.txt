The current Haiku system does not allow any user, 
administrator or not, to have write access to /boot/home/develop/headers
where one headers is stored that cause this package to not build.

The solution to allowing this package to build is somewhat involved.

My approach to building this package was to keep the package code in tact
and edit Haiku's header instead.

PART I. 
You will have to retrieve:
1. /boot/system/develop/headers/arpa/inet.h
and place it in:
1. /boot/home/pkg/include/arpa/inet.h

PART II.

1. Add the patch-git-compat-util.h file provided to the localpatches folder and 
run bmake makepatchsum before attempting to build the package.
When the build starts, the file will be patched to read the modified inet.h 
header.

FOR YOUR INFORMATION ONLY, I HAVE PROVIDED A DIFF FOR THE 
FOLLOWING NON-PATCHABLE SYSTEM FILE:

1. /boot/home/pkg/include/arpa/inet.h

AS STATED ABOVE, I PROVIDED 1 PATCH FOR SOURCE CHANGES

1. patch-git-compat-util.h

TO BUILD THIS PACKAGE, YOU'LL HAVE TO DO A SIMILAR, BUT MORE COMPLICATED 
PROCEDURE FOR P5-SOCKET6.
