The current Haiku system does not allow any user, 
administrator or not, to have write access to /boot/home/develop/headers
where two headers are stored that cause this package to not build.

The solution to allowing this package to build is somewhat involved.
It requires that you are able to edit your perl.h header, which probably means 
you can only do this with pkgsrc. 

My approach to building this package was to keep the package code in tact
and edit Haiku's headers instead.

PART I. 
You will have to retrieve:
1. /boot/system/develop/headers/netdb.h
2. /boot/system/develop/headers/arpa/inet.h
and place them in:
1. /boot/home/pkg/include/netdb.h
2. /boot/home/pkg/include/arpa/inet.h

PART II.

You will also have to temporarily replace the gollowing file, with the Perl.h
file provided -> SO BACK IT UP:

1. Make a copy of /boot/home/pkg/lib/perl5/5.20.0/i386-haiku/CORE/perl.h
and call it /boot/home/pkg/lib/perl5/5.20.0/i386-haiku/CORE/perl.h copy
2. Copy the perl.h file provided and place in in:
/boot/home/pkg/lib/perl5/5.20.0/i386-haiku/CORE/perl.h

PART III.

1. Add the patch-Socket6.xs file provided to the patches folder and 
run bmake makepatchsum before attempting to build the package.
When the build starts, the file will be patched.

FOR YOUR INFORMATION ONLY, I HAVE PROVIDED DIFFS FOR THE 
FOLLOWING NON-PATCHABLE SYSTEM FILES:

1. /boot/home/pkg/include/netdb.h
2. /boot/home/pkg/include/arpa/inet.h
3. /boot/home/pkg/lib/perl5/5.20.0/i386-haiku/CORE/perl.h

AS STATED ABOVE, I PROVIDED 1 PATCH FOR SOURCE CHANGES

1. patch-Socket6.xs

WHEN YOU ARE DONE, REVERT BACK TO THE ORIGINAL PERL.H

1. Delete /boot/home/pkg/lib/perl5/5.20.0/i386-haiku/CORE/perl.h
and rename /boot/home/pkg/lib/perl5/5.20.0/i386-haiku/CORE/perl.h copy
as: /boot/home/pkg/lib/perl5/5.20.0/i386-haiku/CORE/perl.h
