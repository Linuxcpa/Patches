This is in progress work for Python 34. This is the second improved release.
I am going to see if I can get the nis module to behave, but we have an almost complete solution as of now.

As it is now, I have a mostly complete build and better results then with Python 27.

The only item that didn't build was the NIS module

So here is what you have to do:

1. Place the 3 replacement patches in ..pkgsrc/lang/python34/patches and replace the 3 patches of the same name.
2. Place the rest of the 110 patches in the localpatches directory
3. Replace pkgsrc's Makefile and PLIST with the ones in the replacement files folder.
4. Build

Most of the 113 patches end up placing headers where the source can find it.
The remaining patches are mostly standard.
This is because of some pathing issue in Haiku. 

We are almost there, if not. :)
