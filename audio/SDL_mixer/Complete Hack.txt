Forced creation of package from binaries built in Haikuporter.

1. Pkgsrc would not let g++ compile 
2. There were undefined references that were unique to pkgsrc.

Util this is solved, I caused SDL_mixer to become installed in pkgsrc
by unzipping the two packages I built in Haikuporter, manually placing the
binaries, libraries, headers and pkgconfig files where pkgsrc expects them.

/boot/home/pkg/lib
/boot/home/pkg/include
/boot/home/pkg/bin
/boot/home/pkg/lib/pkgconfig

IMPORTANT edit the SDL_mixer.pc file to be consistent with pkgsrc parameters.
Look at the other *.pc files in /boot/home/pkg/lib/pkgconfig and edit to become like those.
