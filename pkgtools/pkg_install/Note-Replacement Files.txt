Creating and applying patches for libfetch works differently.

Once patches are created, a directory called "files" will include
patched versions of the files, digest will not update
and bmake makepatchsum will appear to be broken with response
sh digest not found equal to the number of patches applied.

Furthermore, digest won't update unless bmake mdi is applied.

If you have these symptoms, just check the files directory to see if
.orig files are present. If so, no need to have patches in the patches folder.

I have supplied a Replacement files folder if you can't work this out.
I have also supplied patches, but they need only be applied once, the source
for libfetch comes with pkgsrc, so it doesn't re-extract or populate the 
work directory, if different, with new source that requires patching.

Note that the libfetch and net/libfetch are the same thing, but two different
source code bases. If one requires patches, the other does as well.
